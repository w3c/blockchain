## Application of Blockchain to domain areas, such as:

* Identity systems, including privacy, security, and confidentiality factors
* Ticketing
* Rights expression and licensing
  * Digital media entitlements
  * User focused Digital Rights Management
* Decentralized processing, computing, and storage infrastructure
* Voting systems
* E-discovery capable record keeping systems
* Legal - smart contract to encoding legal agreements between parties
* Audit - reporting and compliance
* Funding and accountancy infrastructure and tracking
* Generic crypto-store (blockchain powered transactional data store)
* Payments platform
* Organization internal currency (chargebacks)
* Modeling of organizational micro-economies (interactions between teams)
* Entitlements tracking
* Intellectual Property (IP) marketplace
* Internal/private prediction market (corporate or organization communications improvement)
* Customer facing currencies (including loyalty programs) - medium of exchange within an ecosystem (physical or virtual/gaming)
* Reservations and booking (e.g. travel, room, table) contracts
* Internet of Things (IoT) security platform (common and secure implementation for configuration, code, and firmware delivery)
* Enterprise systems
  * Shared data with restricted co-tenancy (legal and security requirements for data storage within/out international or other legal boundaries)
  * Real-time Enterprise governance (rules based enterprise-wide validation of transactions and blocks - i.e. disparate segments/business units)
  * Move data to the edge (edge services and mobile subscribe to data feeds of necessary data, which is held local to the service, reducing latency and increasing service uptime/resiliency)
  * Configuration management (security, traceability, and non-repudiation of configuration changes)
  * Enterprise analytics (based upon all activity)
