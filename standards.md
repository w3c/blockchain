In the context of this workshop, the following general criteria are relevant to identify when something is suitable for standardization (which is a particular approach to the larger goal of interoperability):

## Standardization Value and Readiness 

1. __Problem Statement__: Is there a clear problem statement that this would solve, for a significant number of people?
2. __Starting Point__: Is there a good starting point, such as a clear solution, or a set of competing solutions?
3. __Stakeholder Commitment__: Do we have the right stakeholders ready to commit to the work, including implementers who would deploy the feature, and individuals willing to write, review, and test the specification?

## W3C Focus and Fit 

For standardization at W3C specifically, the focus is on the Web, in three main areas:

* **Client-side** (browser-based) features, like markup languages, JavaScript APIs, or user-facing features
  * this is W3C's main focus
* **data and formats**, such as interchange formats, vocabularies/ontologies, and languages to manipulate data
  * _note that this area is usually treated with some skepticism by browser makers_
* **communication protocols** 
  * W3C does this much more rarely, typically only when there's a corresponding client-side API, and usually in partnership with IETF
